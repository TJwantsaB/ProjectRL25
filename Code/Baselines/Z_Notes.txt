# State: [storage_level, price, hour, day]

Consider a datacenter that requires 120 MWh of energy everyday that it needs to buy from the grid at a maximum power rate of 10MW.
An excess of energy supplied to the datacenter of 50MWh.

The datacenter can also act as a storage system by selling to the grid at a maximum power rate of 10MW as long as it is
compensated by buying electricity at other time steps.

It should however never fall below 0 MWh and reach at least 120MWh of positive energy supply by the end of the day.

Selling electricity to the grid only provides 80% compensation of the grid price due to the electricity losses and financial
agreements with the grid.
